          The problems teams deal with mostly boil down to stuff scattered in too many places - emails, chat threads, Word docs, etc. That makes things easy to miss and hard to find, which leads to communication gaps, preventable emergencies, and extra work.
          <br></br>
          Single purpose project management and chat apps can't fix this problem - they can only make it worse. Basecamp is different. 
          It combines all the tools teams need in a single, straightforward package that makes work feel like less work.
          <br></br>
          We use Basecamp to make software (Basecamp!), discuss ideas, plan marketing campaigns, share pet pics - you get the idea.
          It's one stop shop for all the things teams do together.
